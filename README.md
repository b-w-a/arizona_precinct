# Nuno & Wilcox-Archuleta
Data for Arizona Republic OpEd Article

These data can be used to replicate the findings used in the Nuno and Wilcox-Archuleta OpEd in the Arizona Republic. 

2016 precinct level vote returns were downloaded from SOS website (\texttt{http://apps.azsos.gov/results/2016/General/}) and cleaned. Precinct level demographics were obtained via the census redistricting file and a private vendor. These two files were merged to create 2016 vote share for Clinton and Trump as well as percent Latino in the precinct. Precinct weights were obtained as a proportion from the number of voters in each precinct out of the total number of voters in each county. King's EI is available here: \texttt{http://gking.harvard.edu/eiR}

Data were current as of Nov. 22, 2016.
